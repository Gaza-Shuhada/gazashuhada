# Blob Storage Migration - Quick Start

**TL;DR**: CSV files now stored in Vercel Blob instead of PostgreSQL. This improves performance and reduces database costs by ~99%.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Done

- [x] Database schema updated (new columns added)
- [x] Migration applied to database
- [x] Blob storage utility created (`src/lib/blob-storage.ts`)
- [x] Bulk upload service updated to use Blob storage
- [x] Backfill script created for existing data (if any)
- [x] All API endpoints work unchanged

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (To Complete Migration)

### 1. Test New Uploads

Upload a CSV file through the web UI and verify it works:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000/bulk-uploads
# Upload a CSV file
# Check it succeeds
```

### 2. Verify Blob Storage

Check database to confirm Blob URL was stored:

```sql
SELECT filename, fileUrl, fileSize, fileSha256
FROM "BulkUpload"
ORDER BY uploadedAt DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Should see:
- `fileUrl`: `https://blob.vercel-storage.com/...`
- `fileSize`: (bytes)
- `fileSha256`: (hash)

### 3. Backfill Existing Data (If Any)

If you have old uploads with `rawFile` but no `fileUrl`:

```bash
# Check if backfill needed
# Run in psql or Prisma Studio:
# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "BulkUpload" WHERE "fileUrl" IS NULL;

# If count > 0, run backfill:
npx tsx scripts/migrate-bulk-uploads-to-blob.ts --dry-run  # Preview
npx tsx scripts/migrate-bulk-uploads-to-blob.ts            # Apply
```

### 4. Monitor

- No changes to user-facing functionality
- Files now stored in Vercel Blob instead of database
- Everything else works exactly the same

## üîç How It Works

**Before**:
```
CSV upload ‚Üí Stored in PostgreSQL as BYTES ‚Üí Database gets huge
```

**Now**:
```
CSV upload ‚Üí Stored in Vercel Blob ‚Üí Only URL stored in PostgreSQL ‚Üí Database stays lean
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backwards Compatible**: Old `rawFile` column still exists during transition
2. **No Breaking Changes**: All API endpoints work unchanged
3. **Safe to Deploy**: New uploads use Blob storage automatically
4. **Future Cleanup**: After all data migrated, we'll remove `rawFile` column

---

## üìä Impact

### Database Size
- **Before**: ~100 KB per upload record
- **After**: ~200 bytes per upload record
- **Savings**: 99.8% reduction

### Performance
- Faster database queries (smaller rows)
- Reduced database backup size
- Lower database costs

### Cost
- Vercel Blob free tier: 1 GB storage (plenty for this app)
- Database storage: Significantly reduced

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Q: Upload fails with "Blob error"**  
A: Check that `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is set in your `.env` file

**Q: Old uploads show NULL for fileUrl**  
A: Run the backfill script: `npx tsx scripts/migrate-bulk-uploads-to-blob.ts`

**Q: Can I revert this change?**  
A: Yes, but not recommended. The old `rawFile` column still exists during transition period.
