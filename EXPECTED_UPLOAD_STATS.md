## How to Verify

### After Each Upload:
1. Check the stats shown in the UI match expectations
2. Look at the "Inserts" - should decrease over time as more records exist
3. Look at "Updates" - should increase over time
4. After upload #6, verify English names are populated

### Database Queries to Run:

**Check total active records:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_persons 
FROM "Person" 
WHERE "isDeleted" = false;
```

**Check English name coverage:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT("nameEnglish") as with_english,
  ROUND(COUNT("nameEnglish")::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as percentage
FROM "Person" 
WHERE "isDeleted" = false;
```

**Check change type distribution:**
```sql
SELECT 
  "changeType", 
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM "PersonVersion"
GROUP BY "changeType"
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**View sample records with English names:**
```sql
SELECT 
  "externalId",
  "name",
  "nameEnglish",
  "gender",
  "dateOfBirth"
FROM "Person"
WHERE "nameEnglish" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check upload history:**
```sql
SELECT 
  "filename",
  "label",
  "dateReleased",
  "uploadedAt"
FROM "BulkUpload"
ORDER BY "dateReleased" ASC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Inserts are 0 on first upload:
- ‚ùå Problem: Database wasn't cleared
- ‚úÖ Solution: Run `npx tsx scripts/clear-database.ts`

### If Updates are 0 on later uploads:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is unusual but possible if data is identical
- Check if you uploaded the same file twice

### If Deletes are > 0:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This means records in the database aren't in the new file
- Verify you're uploading files in chronological order
- Each file should be cumulative (include all previous records + new ones)

### If English Names are 0 after upload #6:
- ‚ùå Problem: name_en column not being imported
- ‚úÖ Check that the file has name_en column
- ‚úÖ Check console logs for errors
