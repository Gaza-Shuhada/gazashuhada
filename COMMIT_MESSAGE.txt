feat: Finalize Blob storage migration and add admin settings page

## 🎯 Overview
Completed Blob storage migration by removing all backwards compatibility code,
added admin settings page with database clear functionality, and codified
"Move Fast, No Cruft" development philosophy.

## 🗄️ Database - Blob Storage Finalization
- Created migration: 20251006105824_finalize_blob_storage_remove_rawfile
- Made Blob storage fields required (NOT NULL): fileUrl, fileSize, fileSha256, contentType
- Dropped rawFile column completely from BulkUpload table
- Deleted 1 legacy record without Blob URL (clean slate)

## 🧹 Code Cleanup - Zero Backwards Compatibility
- Deleted src/lib/bulk-upload-service.ts (original service with rawFile)
- Deleted src/lib/bulk-upload-service-optimized.ts (intermediate version)
- Consolidated all functions into bulk-upload-service-ultra-optimized.ts:
  - simulateBulkUpload()
  - applyBulkUpload()
  - rollbackBulkUpload() (moved from old service)
- Removed all "Legacy" handling from BulkUploadsClient.tsx
- Removed nullable checks for fileUrl and fileSize (now required)
- Updated scripts to use ultra-optimized service:
  - scripts/automated-upload-test.ts
  - scripts/sequential-upload.ts

## 🎨 UI Improvements
- Moved Apply/Cancel buttons above sample records in bulk uploads
- Error messages now always visible without scrolling
- Better UX for reviewing simulation results before applying

## ⚙️ Admin Settings Page (NEW)
- Created /admin/settings page with "Danger Zone" section
- Added "Clear Database" functionality with:
  - Comprehensive warning dialog
  - Double confirmation (button + dialog)
  - Success feedback with deletion statistics
  - Admin-only access (protected by layout + API)
- Created /api/admin/clear-database endpoint:
  - Deletes all Person, PersonVersion, BulkUpload, ChangeSource, CommunitySubmission records
  - Creates audit log for accountability
  - Returns statistics of deleted records
- Added "Settings" link to navbar (admin-only, both mobile & desktop)
- Fixed hydration error in AlertDialog (used asChild prop)

## 📚 Documentation & Philosophy
- Updated .cursorrules with "Move Fast, No Cruft" section:
  - Zero backwards compatibility policy
  - Clean deletion guidelines
  - Fresh start > gradual migration
  - Code examples and decision framework
- Cleaned up docs/TODO.md:
  - Added workflow documentation at top
  - Removed all completed tasks (151 lines)
  - Only active tasks remain (79 lines total)
  - Philosophy: "When tasks are done, they go in commit message"
- Updated docs/BLOB_STORAGE_MIGRATION.md:
  - Removed all backwards compatibility references
  - Clean, forward-only documentation
  - Philosophy: "Move fast, no cruft"

## 🔧 Build & Type Safety
- Regenerated Prisma client after schema changes
- Fixed old Prisma client in .next build directory (clean rebuild)
- Added alert-dialog shadcn component
- All 22 routes compile successfully (added /admin/settings)
- Production build validated (exit code 0)

## 🔒 Security
- Admin settings page protected by:
  - Client-side layout (admin role check)
  - Server-side API endpoint (requireAdmin())
  - Navbar visibility (admin-only)
- Clear database requires double confirmation with warnings

## 🗑️ Files Deleted
- src/lib/bulk-upload-service.ts
- src/lib/bulk-upload-service-optimized.ts
- scripts/migrate-bulk-uploads-to-blob.ts (no longer needed)
- scripts/delete-legacy-uploads.ts (one-time cleanup)

## 📁 Files Added
- src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx
- src/app/api/admin/clear-database/route.ts
- src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx
- prisma/migrations/20251006105824_finalize_blob_storage_remove_rawfile/

## 📝 Files Modified

- src/components/Navbar.tsx (added Settings link for admins)
- src/app/bulk-uploads/BulkUploadsClient.tsx (moved buttons, removed legacy handling)
- src/lib/bulk-upload-service-ultra-optimized.ts (added rollbackBulkUpload function)

## 🎯 Philosophy
"Move fast, no cruft. Zero backwards compatibility. When we delete, we delete clean."

## ✅ Testing
- [x] Database clear functionality tested
- [x] Production build validated
- [x] Admin-only access verified
- [x] Blob storage working without rawFile column
- [x] All imports updated and working

Breaking Changes: None (Blob storage already in use from previous commit)
