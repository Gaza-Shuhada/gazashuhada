fix: Resolve form submission UI freezing and improve UX across all pages

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix: Form Submission Hanging

Fixed a critical bug where all form submissions would hang, leaving buttons 
disabled and preventing users from seeing success/error messages.

### Root Cause
- Using `response.json()` directly would hang on empty/invalid responses
- Synchronous `fetchX()` calls blocked UI updates
- Success handlers ran async operations before scrolling/showing messages

### Solution Applied System-Wide
1. **Safe JSON Parsing**: Replace all `response.json()` with:
   ```typescript
   const text = await response.text();
   const data = text ? JSON.parse(text) : {};
   ```

2. **Non-blocking Refreshes**: Changed from:
   ```typescript
   fetchSubmissions(); // Blocks
   ```
   To:
   ```typescript
   fetchSubmissions().catch(err => console.error(...)); // Non-blocking
   ```

3. **Immediate UI Feedback**: Move `window.scrollTo()` to run FIRST before 
   any async operations

## 📁 Files Fixed (8 files, 20+ locations)

### Community Submissions (`src/app/community/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Fixed `handleNewRecordSubmit` - scroll to top on success/error
- ✅ Fixed `handleEditSubmit` - scroll to top on success/error
- ✅ Fixed `fetchSubmissions` - safe JSON parsing
- ✅ Fixed `uploadPhoto` - safe JSON parsing with error handling
- ✅ Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- ✅ Reordered tabs: "Suggest Edit" now appears before "Propose New Record"
- ✅ Fixed tab hover text shifting (use `hover:border-muted` instead of `hover:border`)
- ✅ Added `transition-colors` for smooth hover animations

### Photo Upload API (`src/app/api/upload-photo/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added detailed logging at every step
- ✅ Better error messages with context
- ✅ Logs file metadata, processing steps, Blob URLs

### Moderation (`src/app/moderation/ModerationClient.tsx`)
- ✅ Fixed `fetchSubmissions` - safe JSON parsing
- ✅ Fixed `handleApprove` - non-blocking refresh
- ✅ Fixed `handleReject` - non-blocking refresh

### Bulk Uploads (`src/app/bulk-uploads/BulkUploadsClient.tsx`)
- ✅ Fixed `fetchUploads` - safe JSON parsing
- ✅ Fixed `handleSimulate` - safe JSON parsing
- ✅ Fixed `handleApply` - non-blocking refresh
- ✅ Fixed `handleRollback` - non-blocking refresh

### Admin Settings (`src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Fixed `handleClearDatabase` - safe JSON parsing

### Audit Logs (`src/app/audit-logs/AuditLogsClient.tsx`)
- ✅ Fixed `fetchLogs` - safe JSON parsing

## 🎯 Impact

### Before
- ❌ Submit button stays disabled after successful submission
- ❌ Page doesn't scroll to show success/error messages
- ❌ User stuck at bottom of page, unaware submission worked
- ❌ No console logs for debugging
- ❌ Forms appear "frozen" even when data is saved

### After
- ✅ Buttons always unlock (success or error)
- ✅ Page always scrolls to top to show messages
- ✅ Clear success/error feedback
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Non-blocking background refreshes
- ✅ Smooth, responsive UI

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- Reordered community tabs for better workflow (Edit → New → History)
- Fixed hover text shifting on tabs with proper border handling
- Added smooth color transitions on tab hover
- Success messages appear immediately with smooth scroll

## 🔧 Technical Details

- All `.json()` calls replaced with safe parsing pattern
- All refresh functions made non-blocking with `.catch()` handlers
- Scroll actions moved before async operations for immediate feedback
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent parent form handlers
- Consistent error handling across all forms

## ✅ Testing

- All linting checks pass
- No TypeScript errors
- Tested in development environment
- Applied consistently across 8 files

## 🚀 Affected Features

- Community submissions (new records + edits)
- Photo uploads
- Moderation (approve/reject)
- Bulk CSV uploads (simulate/apply/rollback)
- Database clearing
- Audit log viewing
