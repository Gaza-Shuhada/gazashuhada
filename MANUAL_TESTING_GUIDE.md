## What to Watch For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- No error messages
- Simulation shows expected changes
- Upload completes successfully
- Stats look reasonable

### üîç Things to Verify

**For early files (2024-01-05):**
- All records should be INSERTs (first upload)
- No English names (nameEnglish = null)

**For later files (2025-03-23 onwards):**
- Should have some INSERTs and UPDATEs
- All records should have English names
- Check a few records in the database to verify nameEnglish field

**For all files:**
- Gender should be normalized (M/F ‚Üí MALE/FEMALE)
- Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Empty DOB should be handled gracefully

### ‚ùå Potential Issues

**"Missing required column(s)"**
- CSV headers not matching expected format
- Should not happen with MOH files

**"Invalid gender"**
- Gender value not M/F/O
- Should not happen with MOH files

**"Failed to apply"**
- Check console logs
- May need to rollback previous upload

## Tracking Your Results

Create a simple spreadsheet or note to track:

| Upload # | Date Released | File | Inserts | Updates | Deletes | Total Records | Notes |
|----------|--------------|------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | 2024-01-05 | 2024-01-05.csv | | | | 14,140 | First upload |
| 2 | 2024-03-29 | 2024-03-29.csv | | | | 20,390 | |
| ... | | | | | | | |

## After All Uploads

### Final Verification

1. **Check total records:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Person" WHERE "isDeleted" = false;
   ```
   Expected: ~60,199 active records

2. **Check English names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Person" WHERE "nameEnglish" IS NOT NULL;
   ```
   Expected: ~223,801 records with English names

3. **Check versions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "changeType", COUNT(*) FROM "PersonVersion" GROUP BY "changeType";
   ```

4. **View sample record:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "name", "nameEnglish", "gender", "dateOfBirth" 
   FROM "Person" 
   WHERE "nameEnglish" IS NOT NULL 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

### Rollback Testing (Optional)

If you want to test rollback:
1. Go to Bulk Uploads list
2. Click "Rollback" on the most recent upload
3. Verify the stats (should reverse the changes)
4. Check database counts
5. Re-upload the file to restore

## Tips

- **Take your time**: Each upload may take 10-30 seconds
- **Use simulation first**: Always simulate before applying
- **Keep notes**: Track the stats for each upload
- **Watch the console**: Check browser console for any errors
- **Database checks**: Periodically check the database between uploads

## Need to Start Over?

If something goes wrong and you want to start fresh, use the clear data script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/clear-database.ts
```

Then start from upload #1 again.
