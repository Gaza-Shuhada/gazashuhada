## üîß Development

### Database Schema Updates

The application uses Prisma with PostgreSQL. Recent schema changes:
- Added `BulkUpload.label` field (nullable String)
- Moved `changeType` from `ChangeSource` to `PersonVersion`
- Added `AuditLog` table for comprehensive activity tracking
- Multiple performance indexes on `PersonVersion`

Run migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
# or for production:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Testing

To test bulk upload functionality:
1. Navigate to `/bulk-uploads` (admin account required)
2. Upload test CSV from `docs/seed.csv`
3. Provide a descriptive label (e.g., "Test Upload")
4. Review simulation showing all changes
5. Apply or cancel as needed
6. Test rollback on past uploads
