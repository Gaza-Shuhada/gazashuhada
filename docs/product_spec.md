# Product Specification - Admin Tools

## Overview
**Staff-Only Internal Administration Tool** for managing versioned records of people. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: This is the **admin tools only**. A separate public-facing web application will be built for end-users to consume the data with advanced search, filtering, sorting, analytics, and visualization features. These admin tools are focused exclusively on:
> - Data management (bulk uploads, versioning)
> - Moderation (reviewing community submissions)
> - Internal operations (audit logs, access control)
> - NOT designed for general public data browsing

The admin system supports:
- **Bulk file uploads** (admin-only) with preview, apply, and rollback capabilities
- **Complete versioning system** tracking all changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Audit logging** of all administrative actions
- **Role-based access control** (Admin and Moderator roles)
- **Basic database browsing** for staff verification purposes
- **Traceability** from versions back to their origin (`ChangeSource`)

**Note**: This is a staff-only application. Community members have no access to any admin features.
