refactor: separate admin tools and public site with dedicated navigation

Major restructure to isolate admin tools under /tools with separate navigation:

- Move all admin pages to /tools/* (settings, bulk-uploads, moderation, audit-logs)
- Create PublicNavbar for public pages (/, /community, /records)
- Create ToolsNavbar for admin tools (/tools/*)
- Update middleware with staff route protection
- Fix optional chaining runtime error in admin dashboard stats
- Rename navbar labels: Community→Submissions, Records→Database
- Consolidate /tools/admin to /tools
- Remove redundant Dashboard link (logo serves as home)

Public pages stay at root, admin tools isolated under /tools.
All 26 routes validated, production build passing.
