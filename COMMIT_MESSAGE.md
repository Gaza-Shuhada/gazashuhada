# Fix: 413 Payload Too Large Error on Bulk Upload

## Overview
**Critical production hotfix** - Resolves 413 Payload Too Large error that occurs when applying bulk uploads with large datasets (50K+ changes).

## Problem
When uploading large CSV files (e.g., MoH dataset with 31K updates + 18K inserts), the apply step failed with:
```
413 Payload Too Large
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'R', "Request En"... is not valid JSON
```

**Root Cause**: The client was sending the full simulation data (all insert/update/delete records) in the POST request body. For large datasets, this JSON payload exceeded Vercel's **4.5 MB request size limit**.

Example payload sizes:
- 50K records √ó ~200 bytes each = **~10 MB** (exceeds limit)
- Vercel rejected the request with 413 HTTP error
- Response was HTML error page, not JSON, causing parsing error

## Solution
Implemented automatic payload size detection with intelligent fallback:

### 1. Client-Side (`BulkUploadsClient.tsx`)
- **Checks simulation data size** before sending
- If > 3 MB (safety threshold): Sends `simulationData: null`
- If ‚â§ 3 MB: Sends full simulation data (fast path)
- Shows user notification when fallback mode is triggered

```typescript
const simulationSize = new Blob([JSON.stringify(simulation)]).size;
if (simulationSize > 3 * 1024 * 1024) {
  // Send null - server will re-parse CSV
  payloadData = { blobUrl, simulationData: null, ... };
  toast.loading('Large dataset - server will re-process CSV');
} else {
  // Send full simulation - fast path
  payloadData = { blobUrl, simulationData: simulation, ... };
}
```

### 2. Server-Side (`bulk-upload-service-ultra-optimized.ts`)
- **Accepts optional simulation data** (was required before)
- If `simulationData` is null: Downloads CSV from blob and re-simulates
- If `simulationData` provided: Uses it directly (existing fast path)

```typescript
if (!simulationData) {
  console.log('Re-parsing CSV from blob (fallback mode)');
  const csvBuffer = await downloadFromBlob(blobUrl);
  const csvContent = csvBuffer.toString('utf-8');
  const rows = parseCSV(csvContent);
  simulationData = await simulateBulkUpload(rows);
}
```

## Technical Details

### Payload Size Calculation
- **Safety threshold**: 3 MB (Vercel limit is 4.5 MB)
- Uses `Blob` API to measure exact JSON size
- Logged to console for debugging

### Fallback Performance
- **Small files** (<3 MB simulation): ~2-3 min (fast path, unchanged)
- **Large files** (>3 MB simulation): ~3-4 min (adds ~30-60s for re-simulation)
- Trade-off: Slightly slower but reliable for large datasets

### Files Modified
1. `src/lib/bulk-upload-service-ultra-optimized.ts`
   - Added fallback logic to re-parse CSV when no simulation data
   - Imported `parseCSV` and `downloadFromBlob`
   - Updated function documentation

2. `src/app/tools/bulk-uploads/BulkUploadsClient.tsx`
   - Added payload size detection (3 MB threshold)
   - Conditionally sends simulation data or null
   - Shows user-facing toast notification for large datasets

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Small uploads (<10K records): Uses fast path ‚úÖ
- [x] Large uploads (>50K records): Uses fallback, no 413 error ‚úÖ
- [x] Console logs show size detection and fallback trigger ‚úÖ
- [x] User notification appears for large datasets ‚úÖ
- [x] Re-simulation logic works correctly ‚úÖ
- [x] No linter errors ‚úÖ

## Impact

### Before
- ‚ùå Large uploads (>50K changes) failed with 413 error
- ‚ùå User got cryptic JSON parsing error
- ‚ùå No way to upload large MoH datasets

### After
- ‚úÖ All uploads work regardless of size
- ‚úÖ Small uploads use fast path (unchanged speed)
- ‚úÖ Large uploads use fallback (reliable, slightly slower)
- ‚úÖ User gets clear notification about processing mode
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging for debugging

## Deployment Priority

**üö® URGENT - Deploy immediately**

This is a critical production bug blocking bulk upload functionality for large datasets. The fix is backwards compatible and has no breaking changes.

## Related Issues

This issue was discovered during production upload of MoH-2025-07-31.csv dataset:
- 31,528 updates
- 18,492 inserts
- Simulation data: ~8 MB (exceeded 4.5 MB limit)
