# Troubleshooting Guide for GitHub Issues #1 and #2

## üìã Overview

This guide helps diagnose and fix:
- **Issue #2**: "Propose new record - Internal server error"
- **Issue #1**: "Bulk Upload - Failed to simulate upload"

## üîß What We Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging (Commit `bb6c1b0`)
- Added detailed error messages to API responses
- Added console logging for debugging in Vercel logs
- Error responses now include `details` field with specific error messages

### 2. Database Migration on Build (Commit `b10b2f4`)
- Vercel now runs `prisma migrate deploy` before building
- Ensures database schema is always up-to-date
- Prevents "column doesn't exist" errors

## üîç How to Diagnose Issues

### Step 1: Check Error Details in App

Users should now see specific error messages instead of generic "Internal server error":

**Before:**
```json
{
  "error": "Internal server error"
}
```

**Now:**
```json
{
  "error": "Internal server error",
  "details": "Missing required field: externalId"  // ‚Üê Specific error!
}
```

Ask users to **share the `details` field** from the error message.

### Step 2: Check Vercel Logs

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs**

Look for these log entries:

#### For Issue #2 (Community Submit):
```
[Community Submit] User: user_xyz123 Role: admin
[Community Submit] Error: ...actual error...
[Community Submit] Error stack: ...full trace...
```

#### For Issue #1 (Bulk Upload):
```
[Bulk Upload Simulate] User: user_xyz123 Role: admin
[Bulk Upload Simulate] Error: ...actual error...
[Bulk Upload Simulate] Error stack: ...full trace...
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue #2: "Propose new record - Internal server error"

#### Possible Cause 1: Missing Environment Variables

**Check in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:**

Required variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - Vercel Blob storage token
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Clerk public key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk secret key

**Fix:** Add missing environment variables, then redeploy.

---

#### Possible Cause 2: Database Not Migrated

**Symptoms:**
- Error message mentions "column does not exist"
- Error mentions "table does not exist"

**Fix:**
‚úÖ Already fixed! New deployments automatically run migrations.

**Manual fix (if needed):**
```bash
# In Vercel project terminal or locally with production DATABASE_URL:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

#### Possible Cause 3: Invalid Data Format

**Symptoms:**
- Error mentions "Invalid gender value"
- Error mentions "Invalid date format"
- Error mentions "Missing required field"

**Fix:** Check the data being submitted:

**Required fields for new record:**
- `externalId` (string)
- `name` (string)
- `gender` (must be: "MALE", "FEMALE", or "OTHER")
- `dateOfBirth` (format: "YYYY-MM-DD")

**Optional fields:**
- `dateOfDeath` (format: "YYYY-MM-DD")
- `locationOfDeathLat` (number between -90 and 90)
- `locationOfDeathLng` (number between -180 and 180)
- `obituary` (string)
- `photoUrlThumb` (string)
- `photoUrlOriginal` (string)

---

#### Possible Cause 4: Duplicate External ID

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "A person with this External ID already exists"

**Fix:** Use "Suggest Edit" instead of "Propose New Record" for existing records.

---

### Issue #1: "Bulk Upload - Failed to simulate upload"

#### Possible Cause 1: User Not Admin

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Unauthorized - requires admin role"
- 403 Forbidden status

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Users**
2. Find the user (e.g., wilgrace)
3. Click on user ‚Üí Metadata ‚Üí Public Metadata
4. Add:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```
5. Save

---

#### Possible Cause 2: Invalid CSV Format

**Symptoms:**
- Error mentions "CSV parsing failed"
- Error mentions "Invalid date format in row X"
- Error mentions "Missing required column"

**Required CSV columns:**
- `external_id` (string)
- `name` (string)
- `name_english` (string, can be empty)
- `gender` (string: "M", "F", or "Male", "Female")
- `date_of_birth` (format: "YYYY-MM-DD" or "DD/MM/YYYY")

**Optional columns:**
- `date_of_death`
- `age`

**CSV example:**
```csv
external_id,name,name_english,gender,date_of_birth
12345,ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ£ÿ≠ŸÖÿØ,Mohammad Ahmad,M,1990-01-15
67890,ŸÅÿßÿ∑ŸÖÿ© ÿπŸÑŸä,Fatima Ali,F,1985-03-20
```

#### Possible Cause 3: File Too Large

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Transaction timeout"
- Request takes very long then fails

**Fix:**
- Split large CSV files into smaller batches (recommend <5000 rows per file)
- Or upgrade Vercel plan for longer function timeouts

---

#### Possible Cause 4: Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Error mentions "database connection"
- Error mentions "connection timeout"

**Fix:**
1. Check `DATABASE_URL` is correct in Vercel environment variables
2. Check PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
3. Check database connection limits haven't been exceeded

2. **Vercel Build Logs** (deployment):
   ```
   Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest
   Check for: "prisma migrate deploy" success
   ```

3. **Database State**:
   ```bash
   # Connect to production database
   npx prisma studio --browser none
   
   # Check migrations applied
   SELECT * FROM "_prisma_migrations" ORDER BY finished_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
